# 🎄❄️☃️🎅 Advent of Code - 2021 🎄❄️☃️🎅
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles.

This year, I've decided to solve them in [Go](https://golang.org/).

You can also see my previous years: [2020](https://github.com/SwiftPush/advent-of-code-2020), [2019](https://github.com/SwiftPush/advent-of-code-2019), [2018](https://github.com/SwiftPush/advent-of-code-2018) and [2017](https://github.com/SwiftPush/advent-of-code-2017).

## Running
```bash
go run cmd/main.go 1 day01/sample_input.txt
